# App Flow: Feedback Swap Platform

The user lands on the homepage with a simple call to action: “Swap Feedback.”

Clicking the CTA brings the user to the upload screen where they can either paste a public track link (e.g. SoundCloud, Dropbox) or upload an audio file directly. They can enter optional metadata such as genre, track title, and feedback focus (e.g. mixing, songwriting).

Once uploaded, the user is placed into the matching queue. When a second user uploads a track, the backend pairs them. Each user receives the other's track and a structured feedback form.

The user must complete the form before unlocking their own received feedback. The form includes sliders and short answers across categories like Mix, Composition, Creativity, and Suggestions.

Once both users submit, each receives the other's comments and can rate the usefulness of the feedback. Users may also flag feedback for spam, disrespectful tone, or suspected song theft.

A basic dashboard shows prior matches, past feedback given/received, and flag status. Optional admin dashboard provides moderation tools.
